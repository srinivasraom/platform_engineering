# Platform Engineering
- Platform engineering is the practice of designing, building, and maintaining internal developer platforms (IDPs) and shared infrastructure that enable software engineers to build and run applications reliably, securely, and efficiently.
- This means creating highly automated, scalable, and reusable systems that power applications and services.
- The platform engineering typically looks at:
  - Building internal platforms
    - Build shared services and platform APIs that application teams can use instead of reinventing the wheel.  Below are few examples.
        - Container orchestration systems
        - Distributed SQL database
        - Internal CI/CD pipelines
        - Observability tooling
  - Infrastructure Abstraction
    - Platform teams abstract complex infrastructure (networking, storage, compute) behind APIs, CLIs, or UIs so developers don’t have to manage low-level details. Below are few examples.
      - Engineers use internal tools to deploy microservices without worrying about provisioning VMs or managing load balancing.
  - Developer Experience
    - Focus on automating workflows: test, build, deploy, monitor.
    - Using tools to help with fast, reproducible builds.
    - Internal dashboards, service mesh tools, and security automation help developers stay productive and compliant.
  - Security and Compliance by default
    - Embed teams with zero-trust security, IAM policies, and data governance into the platform so teams automatically follow best practices.
      - Example: enforcing encryption at rest and in transit without developer effort.
  - Scalability and reliability
    - Everything is built with planet-scale reliability in mind: multi-region redundancy, automated failover, monitoring, and self-healing.
    - SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) teams work closely with platform engineers to make sure the platforms meet strict SLIs and SLOs.
      - SLI (Service Level Indicator) - What are we measuring as concrete metric.
      - SLO (Service Level Objective) - What is our promise / goal to meet the SLI.
      - SLA (Service Level Agreement) - A formal legal agreement with a customer that states the consequences (like penalties) if you don’t meet the SLO.
      - SLI (metric) → SLO (goal for metric) → SLA (contractual commitment)
